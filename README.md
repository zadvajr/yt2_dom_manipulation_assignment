# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Assignment - Youthrive Cohort 2 Programme

Write JavaScript code to interact with the DOM and update web page content.
Create interactive web applications with event listeners and DOM manipulation.

To complete this project, please use the figma link attached to this assignment to design the layout exactly (HTML and CSS). Next use JavaScript to make it interactive by applying what we learned in JavaScript Fundamentals and JavaScript DOM Manipulation

**Some reminders**

- Test your code properly before submitting
- Use ./ instead of / when linking external css or js or path to an image
- A JavaScript project needs a html file
- Submit earlier so I can review it an point out areas of weakness at least two days before the due date
- Pay attention to details. if you do exactly what is on the figma design, you get your full score and if the html, css and js is your own work and not copied
- Start on time so you can complete or do half of the project because this assignment and the rest from now on prepares you for your final project(full frontend e-commerce webpage with react). **_Please tighten your seat belt now you do not feel overwhelmed_**

  **A tip to work better on view only mod**
  _To get spacing between close elements, hold alt and move your cursor_

**Submit:** Push your assignment to GitHub and submit the link
